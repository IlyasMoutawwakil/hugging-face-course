    "## The ü§ó Datasets library\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "In Chapter 3 you got your first taste of the ü§ó Datasets library and saw that there were three main steps when it came to fine-tuning a model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load a dataset from the Hugging Face Hub.\n",
    "- Preprocess the data with Dataset.map().\n",
    "- Load and compute metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is just scratching the surface of what ü§ó Datasets can do! In this chapter, we will take a deep dive into the library. Along the way, we‚Äôll find answers to the following questions:\n",
    "- What do you do when your dataset is not on the Hub?\n",
    "- How can you slice and dice a dataset? (And what if you really need to use Pandas?)\n",
    "- What do you do when your dataset is huge and will melt your laptop‚Äôs RAM?\n",
    "- What the heck are ‚Äúmemory mapping‚Äù and Apache Arrow?\n",
    "- How can you create your own dataset and push it to the Hub?\n",
    "\n",
    "The techniques you learn here will prepare you for the advanced tokenization and fine-tuning tasks in Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 ‚Äî so grab a coffee and let‚Äôs get started!"
