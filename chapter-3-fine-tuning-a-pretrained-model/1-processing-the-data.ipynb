    "Now that we have our dataset and a data collator, we need to put them together. We could manually load batches and collate them, but thatâ€™s a lot of work, and probably not very performant either. Instead, thereâ€™s a simple method that offers a performant solution to this problem: **to_tf_dataset()**. This will wrap a tf.data.Dataset around your dataset, with an optional collation function. tf.data.Dataset is a native TensorFlow format that Keras can use for model.fit(), so this one method immediately converts a ðŸ¤— Dataset to a format thatâ€™s ready for training. Letâ€™s see it in action with our dataset!"
