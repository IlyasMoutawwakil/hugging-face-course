        "- **October 2018: BERT**, another large pretrained model, this one designed to produce better summaries of sentences (more on this in the next chapter!)\n",
        "- **February 2019: GPT-2**, an improved (and bigger) version of GPT that was not immediately publicly released due to ethical concerns\n",

        "- For the same reason, the amount of time and resources needed to get good results are much lower.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, one could leverage a pretrained model trained on the English language and then fine-tune it on an arXiv corpus, resulting in a science/research-based model. The fine-tuning will only require a limited amount of data: the knowledge the pretrained model has acquired is “transferred,” hence the term **transfer learning**.\n",

        "This process will also achieve better results than training from scratch (unless you have lots of data), which is why you should always try to leverage a pretrained model — one as close as possible to the task you have at hand — and fine-tune it."

        "**A key feature of Transformer models** is that they are built with special layers called **attention layers**. In fact, the title of the paper introducing the Transformer architecture was [“Attention Is All You Need”!](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) <br>\n",
        "We will explore the details of **attention layers** later in the course; for now, all you need to know is that **this layer will tell the model to pay specific attention to certain words in the sentence you passed it (and more or less ignore the others)** when dealing with the representation of each word.\n",
        "\n",
        "To put this into context, consider the task of translating text from English to French. Given the input “You like this course”, a translation model will need to also attend to the adjacent word “You” to get the proper translation for the word “like”, because in French the verb “like” is conjugated differently depending on the subject. The rest of the sentence, however, is not useful for the translation of that word. In the same vein, when translating “this” the model will also need to pay attention to the word “course”, because “this” translates differently depending on whether the associated noun is masculine or feminine. Again, the other words in the sentence will not matter for the translation of “this”. With more complex sentences (and more complex grammar rules), the model would need to pay special attention to words that might appear farther away in the sentence to properly translate each word.\n",
        "\n",
        "The same concept applies to any task associated with natural language: a word by itself has a meaning, but that meaning is deeply affected by the context, which can be any other word (or words) before or after the word being studied.\n",

        "### The original architecture\n",
        "The Transformer architecture was originally designed for translation. During training, the encoder receives inputs (sentences) in a certain language, while the decoder receives the same sentences in the desired target language. In the encoder, the attention layers can use all the words in a sentence (since, as we just saw, the translation of a given word can be dependent on what is after as well as before it in the sentence). The decoder, however, works sequentially and can only pay attention to the words in the sentence that it has already translated (so, only the words before the word currently being generated). For example, when we have predicted the first three words of the translated target, we give them to the decoder which then uses all the inputs of the encoder to try to predict the fourth word.\n",
        "\n",
        "To speed things up during training (when the model has access to target sentences), the decoder is fed the whole target, but it is not allowed to use future words (if it had access to the word at position 2 when trying to predict the word at position 2, the problem would not be very hard!). For instance, when trying to predict the fourth word, the attention layer will only have access to the words in positions 1 to 3.\n",

        "It can thus access the whole input sentence to best predict the current word. This is very useful as different languages can have grammatical rules that put the words in different orders, or some context provided later in the sentence may be helpful to determine the best translation of a given word.\n",
        "\n",
        "The attention mask can also be used in the encoder/decoder to prevent the model from paying attention to some special words — for instance, the special padding word used to make all the inputs the same length when batching together sentences."
