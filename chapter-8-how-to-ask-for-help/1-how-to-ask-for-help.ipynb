    "### Introduction\n",
    "Now that you know how to tackle the most common NLP tasks with ðŸ¤— Transformers, you should be able to get started on your own projects! In this chapter we will explore what to do when you hit a problem. Youâ€™ll learn how to successfully debug your code or your training, and how to ask the community for help if you donâ€™t manage to solve the problem by yourself. And if you think youâ€™ve found a bug in one of the Hugging Face libraries, weâ€™ll show you the best way to report it so that the issue is resolved as quickly as possible.\n",

    "More precisely, in this chapter you will learn:\n",
    "- The first thing to do when you get an error\n",
    "- How to ask for help on the forums\n",
    "- How to debug your training pipeline\n",
    "- How to write a good issue\n",
    "\n",
    "None of this is specifically related to ðŸ¤— Transformers or the Hugging Face ecosystem, of course; the lessons from this chapter are applicable to most open source projects!"
