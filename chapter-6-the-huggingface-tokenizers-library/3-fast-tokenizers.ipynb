    "### Fast tokenizers' special powers\n",
    "In this section we will take a closer look at the capabilities of the tokenizers in ü§ó Transformers. Up to now we have only used them to tokenize inputs or decode IDs back into text, but tokenizers ‚Äî especially those backed by the ü§ó Tokenizers library ‚Äî can do a lot more. To illustrate these additional features, we will explore how to reproduce the results of the token-classification (that we called ner) and question-answering pipelines that we first encountered in Chapter 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following discussion, we will often make the distinction between ‚Äúslow‚Äù and ‚Äúfast‚Äù tokenizers. Slow tokenizers are those written in Python inside the ü§ó Transformers library, while the fast versions are the ones provided by ü§ó Tokenizers, which are written in Rust. If you remember the table from Chapter 5 that reported how long it took a fast and a slow tokenizer to tokenize the Drug Review Dataset, you should have an idea of why we call them fast and slow:\n",

    "As we saw earlier, there are 9 labels: O is the label for the tokens that are not in any named entity (it stands for ‚Äúoutside‚Äù), and we then have two labels for each type of entity (miscellaneous, person, organization, and location). The label B-XXX indicates the token is at the beginning of an entity XXX and the label I-XXX indicates the token is inside the entity XXX. For instance, in the current example we would expect our model to classify the token S as B-PER (beginning of a person entity) and the tokens ##yl, ##va and ##in as I-PER (inside a person entity).\n",

    "You might think the model was wrong in this case as it gave the label I-PER to all four of these tokens, but that‚Äôs not entirely true. There are actually two formats for those B- and I- labels: IOB1 and IOB2. The IOB2 format (in pink below), is the one we introduced whereas in the IOB1 format (in blue), the labels beginning with B- are only ever used to separate two adjacent entities of the same type. The model we are using was fine-tuned on a dataset using that format, which is why it assigns the label I-PER to the S token.\n",
