    "### Training a new tokenizer from an old one\n",
    "If a language model is not available in the language you are interested in, or if your corpus is very different from the one your language model was trained on, you will most likely want to retrain the model from scratch using a tokenizer adapted to your data. That will require training a new tokenizer on your dataset. But what exactly does that mean? When we first looked at tokenizers in Chapter 2, we saw that most Transformer models use a **subword tokenization** algorithm. **To identify which subwords are of interest and occur most frequently in the corpus at hand, the tokenizer needs to take a hard look at all the texts in the corpus ‚Äî a process we call training.** The exact rules that govern this training depend on the type of tokenizer used, and we‚Äôll go over the three main algorithms later in this chapter."

It‚Äôs randomized by nature (meaning you have to set some seeds to get the same results when doing the same training twice). Training a tokenizer is a statistical process that tries to identify which subwords are the best to pick for a given corpus, and the exact rules used to pick them depend on the tokenization algorithm. It‚Äôs deterministic, meaning you always get the same results when training with the same algorithm on the same corpus."
