    "Let’s now dive into translation. This is another [sequence-to-sequence task](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/7), which means it’s a problem that can be formulated as going from one sequence to another. In that sense the problem is pretty close to [summarization](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter7/5), and you could adapt what we will see here to other sequence-to-sequence problems such as:\n",
    "- **Style transfer**: Creating a model that translates texts written in a certain style to another (e.g., formal to casual or Shakespearean English to modern English)\n",
    "- **Generative question answering**: Creating a model that generates answers to questions, given a context\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a big enough corpus of texts in two (or more) languages, you can train a new translation model from scratch like we will in the section on [causal language modeling](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter7/6). It will be faster, however, to fine-tune an existing translation model, be it a multilingual one like **mT5** or **mBART** that you want to fine-tune to a specific language pair, or even a model specialized for translation from one language to another that you want to fine-tune to your specific corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will fine-tune a **Marian model** pretrained to translate from English to French (since a lot of Hugging Face employees speak both those languages) on the [KDE4 dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kde4), which is a dataset of localized files for the [KDE apps](https://apps.kde.org). The model we will use has been pretrained on a large corpus of French and English texts taken from the [Opus dataset](https://opus.nlpl.eu), which actually contains the KDE4 dataset. But even if the pretrained model we use has seen that data during its pretraining, we will see that we can get a better version of it after fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we’re finished, we will have a model able to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the previous sections, you can find the actual model that we’ll train and upload to the Hub using the code below and double-check its predictions [here](https://huggingface.co/huggingface-course/marian-finetuned-kde4-en-to-fr?text=This+plugin+allows+you+to+automatically+translate+web+pages+between+several+languages.)."

    "### Metrics\n",
    "The traditional metric used for translation is the [BLEU score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLEU), introduced in a [2002 article](https://aclanthology.org/P02-1040.pdf) by Kishore Papineni et al. The BLEU score evaluates how close the translations are to their labels. It does not measure the intelligibility or grammatical correctness of the model’s generated outputs, but uses statistical rules to ensure that all the words in the generated outputs also appear in the targets. In addition, there are rules that penalize repetitions of the same words if they are not also repeated in the targets (to avoid the model outputting sentences like \"the the the the the\") and output sentences that are shorter than those in the targets (to avoid the model outputting sentences like \"the\").\n",
    "\n",
    "One weakness with BLEU is that it expects the text to already be tokenized, which makes it difficult to compare scores between models that use different tokenizers. So instead, the most commonly used metric for benchmarking translation models today is [SacreBLEU](https://github.com/mjpost/sacrebleu), which addresses this weakness (and others) by standardizing the tokenization step. To use this metric, we first need to install the SacreBLEU library:"
