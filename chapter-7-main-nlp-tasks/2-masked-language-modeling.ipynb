    "### Fine-tuning a masked language model\n",
    "For many NLP applications involving Transformer models, you can simply take a pretrained model from the Hugging Face Hub and fine-tune it directly on your data for the task at hand. Provided that the corpus used for pretraining is not too different from the corpus used for fine-tuning, transfer learning will usually produce good results.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are a few cases where you’ll want to first fine-tune the language models on your data, before training a task-specific head. For example, if your dataset contains legal contracts or scientific articles, a vanilla Transformer model like BERT will typically treat the domain-specific words in your corpus as rare tokens, and the resulting performance may be less than satisfactory. By fine-tuning the language model on in-domain data you can boost the performance of many downstream tasks, which means you usually only have to do this step once!\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of fine-tuning a pretrained language model on in-domain data is usually called **domain adaptation**. It was popularized in 2018 by [ULMFiT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146), which was one of the first neural architectures (based on LSTMs) to make transfer learning really work for NLP. An example of domain adaptation with ULMFiT is shown in the image below; in this section we’ll do something similar, but with a Transformer instead of an LSTM!\n",

This model was trained using a special technique called [knowledge distillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_distillation), where a large “teacher model” like BERT is used to guide the training of a “student model” that has far fewer parameters.

    "Unlike other tasks like text classification or question answering where we’re given a labeled corpus to train on, with language modeling we don’t have any explicit labels. So how do we determine what makes a good language model? Like with the autocorrect feature in your phone, a good language model is one that assigns high probabilities to sentences that are grammatically correct, and low probabilities to nonsense sentences. To give you a better idea of what this looks like, you can find whole sets of “autocorrect fails” online, where the model in a person’s phone has produced some rather funny (and often inappropriate) completions!\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming our test set consists mostly of sentences that are grammatically correct, then one way to measure the quality of our language model is to calculate the probabilities it assigns to the next word in all the sentences of the test set. High probabilities indicates that the model indicates that the model is not “surprised” or “perplexed” by the unseen examples, and suggests it has learned the basic patterns of grammar in the language. There are various mathematical definitions of perplexity, but the one we’ll use defines it as the exponential of the cross-entropy loss. Thus, we can calculate the perplexity of our pretrained model by using the **model.evaluate()** method to compute the cross-entropy loss on the test set and then taking the exponential of the result:"
